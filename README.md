# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji ðŸ“– next to some key terms. Click on it to see its definition.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases weâ€™ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
